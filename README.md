# 🍕 Fast React Pizza Co.

A simple, dynamic pizza menu app built with **pure React.js** — no bundlers, no frameworks, just core web technologies and React's CDN links.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was part of my practice using **React from scratch**, without any modern tooling like Vite or CRA. Here's what I learned and applied:

- ✅ How to use React and ReactDOM via CDN
- ✅ How JSX compiles to `React.createElement()`
- ✅ Pure component-based architecture
- ✅ One-way data flow using props
- ✅ Props immutability and component reusability
- ✅ Conditional rendering (e.g. sold-out items in gray)
- ✅ Inline styles vs. external CSS
- ✅ File structure with public images and local arrays
- ✅ Setting up root components and using `React.StrictMode`

## 🚀 Project Features

- 📜 A simple pizza menu with a local JavaScript array
- ⚙️ Each pizza is a reusable component
- ⚠️ If a pizza is sold out, it’s styled in gray and marked accordingly
- 🧠 Built entirely without build tools like Webpack or Vite

## 📂 Technologies Used

- React 19 (via CDN)
- HTML & CSS
- No build tools or frameworks
- Local state management with React Hooks

## 🧠 Lessons Summary

- React is **declarative**: we describe what UI should look like, not how to change it manually.
- We can use **React without any tooling**, just by importing it from a CDN.
- `React.createElement` is the core of JSX under the hood.
- Components should be **modular**, **reusable**, and focused on UI + logic + structure.
